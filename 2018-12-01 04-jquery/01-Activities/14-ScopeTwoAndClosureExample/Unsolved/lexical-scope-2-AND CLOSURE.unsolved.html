        // What will this print?
        // A: it will print the current state of this entire object - functions just print name since no assoc val.
        // i.e. {name: "gus", color: "gray", age: 15, printInfo: function}
        // NOTE: When used inside a function, 
        // "this" refers to the object on which the function is invoked. â€“ in this case cat ( using cat.printInfo(); )
        // What you could do in the outer scope is something like
        // var self = this; and then refer to self in the inner function via closure
        // Calling a function without a leading parent object will generally
        // get you the global object which in most browsers means the window object.
        console.log(this);

        // What will this print?
        // A: "Name: - "Gus" - Color: - "gray" - Age: -15"
        // Weird, using comma to separate items logs " - "
        console.log("Name:", this.name, "Color:", this.color, "Age:", this.age);
        // console.log("name: " + this.name);

        var nestedFunction = function () {
          console.log("inside nestedFunction()");

          // What will this print?
          // A: this is messed up since "this" must change in a nested function in a method in an object
          // I am in that nested function, the "this" pointer 
          // is actually pointing to the global "window" object
          // In general there are three ways to setup the this object:

          // 1. someThing.someFunction(arg1, arg2, argN)        // method invocation
          // 2. someFunction.call(someThing, arg1, arg2, argN)
          // 3. someFunction.apply(someThing, [arg1, arg2, argN])

          // Calling a function without a leading parent object will generally
          // get you the global object which in most browsers means the window object.
          console.log(this); // logs window object but not sure why

          // What will this print?
          //  A: these are all undefined so *this* must wont print anything for the properties of this
          console.log("Name:", this.name, "Color:", this.color, "Age:", this.age);
        };

        nestedFunction();

    // JAVASCRIPT CLOSURE
    // ==============================================================================
    var add = (function () {
      var counter = 0;
      return function () {
        counter += 1;
        return counter
      }
    })();

    console.log("add:" + add);
    add();
    add();
    add();
    // the counter is now 3 - Explanation
    // The variable add is assigned the return value of a self-invoking function.
    // The self-invoking function only runs once. It sets the counter to zero (0), and returns a function expression.
    // This way add becomes a function. The "wonderful" part is that it can access the counter in the parent scope.
    // This is called a JavaScript closure. It makes it possible for a function to have "private" variables.
    // The counter is protected by the scope of the anonymous function, and can only be changed using the add function.
    // A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed.
