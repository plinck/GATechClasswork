  <script type="text/javascript">
    // We define a person, and include a method that logs his name along with a greeting.
    var person = {
      name: "Jeff",
      sayHi: function () {
        console.log("Hi, I'm " + this.name);
        console.log(this);
      }
    };

    // When we run it normally, it works like we intended.
    person.sayHi();

    // Hi, I'm Jeff
    // But if we include it in a timeout
    // 
    // does not work as this detaches function from its context.  Just like if you di the following:
    // var closeMenu = myObj.closeMenu;  --- detaching the method from the object
    // closeMenu();
    setTimeout(person.sayHi, 50);

    // This is a work around since by creating anonymous fucntion to wrap it so it can carry its context
    setTimeout(function () {
      person.sayHi();
    }, 5000);

    // IS Es6 we could use bind
    setTimeout(person.sayHi.bind(person),10000);

    // I dont get why this happens, even if you wait to call this 
    // method after a time, why wouldnt it still have object context?
    // The reason for this is that the callback function inside setTimeout is in a different lexical environment. 
    // This is why in ES6+ functions can be defined using =>. 
    // This is so that the code within a function shares the same scope as the function.
    // this inside function points to object, for which function was called.
    // For setTimeout this object is window
    // In this example this is window because setTimeout() is actually window.setTimeout().
    //  In your second sample this is your object myelements.
    // --> Does this mean person.sayHi in timeout uses the scope of setTimeout vs person??

    // We get the following:
    // Hi, I'm
    // Window Object
